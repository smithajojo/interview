Our goal is to design an automobile vehicle selling application that will allow users to browse and purchase new or used cars online. The application will have two types of users: customers and admins. Customers will be able to search and filter through available cars, view details about the cars, and purchase them. Admins will have access to the backend system where they can manage cars, users, and transactions.

Functional Requirements:

User Registration: Customers should be able to register and create an account on the platform by providing basic personal information like name, email, password, and contact number.

User Login: Registered users should be able to log in with their credentials to access their accounts.

Car Search and Filter: Customers should be able to search and filter cars based on various criteria such as make, model, year, price, and location.

Car Details: Customers should be able to view detailed information about the cars, including images, specifications, and other relevant information.

Car Purchase: Customers should be able to purchase cars using various payment methods like credit/debit cards, net banking, or digital wallets.

Admin Dashboard: Admins should be able to access the backend system using their credentials and manage cars, users, and transactions.

Car Management: Admins should be able to add, update, and delete cars from the system.

User Management: Admins should be able to manage users by viewing their details and modifying their account information.

Transaction Management: Admins should be able to view and manage all the transactions that have occurred on the platform, including purchase details and payment information.

Non-functional Requirements:

Security: The platform should be secure and protect users' personal and financial information.

Performance: The platform should be fast and responsive, with minimal downtime.

Scalability: The platform should be scalable and able to handle a large number of users and transactions.

User Experience: The platform should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate.

Accessibility: The platform should be accessible to users with disabilities.

Mobile Responsiveness: The platform should be responsive and accessible on mobile devices.

Reliability: The platform should be reliable and able to handle unexpected errors and crashes.

Technology Stack:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
Back-end: .NET 6, ASP.NET Web API
Database: Microsoft SQL Server, Entity Framework Core
Conclusion:
This design document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of an automobile vehicle selling application. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase cars online, and an admin dashboard for admins to manage cars, users, and transactions. The platform will be secure, fast, and scalable, and built using modern web technologies like .NET 6, ASP.NET Web API, and Entity Framework Core. jQuery will be used to enhance the user experience by adding dynamic functionality to the front-end.
